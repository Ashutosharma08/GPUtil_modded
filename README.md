# GPUtil_modded
GPUtil modded for outputting GPU percentage at that time

GPUtil is python library for monitoring GPU usage, but its main drawback is that you cant store it in a variable or do anything with it. This is modded in such a way that it will return the gpu usage as an integer, which obviously can be stored in a variable, and then be used for making reports on gpu usage in the duration of a process.

NOTE: THE GPU USAGE IS NOT ATTACHED TO ANY PID, IT WILL BE ACCESSED AS THE WHOLE SYSTEM GPU USAGE.
